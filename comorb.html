            <h2 class="main-art-head">Common Comorbidities with Endometriosis</h2>

            <h3 class="info-head" id="cancer">Cancer</h3>

            <p id="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ovarian cancer.</b> Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries, which are the female reproductive glands responsible for producing eggs and hormones. It is often called a "silent killer" because it may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. By the time symptoms such as bloating, pelvic pain, or changes in urinary habits appear, the cancer may have already spread to other parts of the body. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving the prognosis of ovarian cancer.<br><br></p>
            <p id="b">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Breast cancer.</b> Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breast, often in the ducts or lobules. It is one of the most common cancers affecting women. Symptoms may include a lump in the breast, changes in breast shape or size, and skin changes. Early detection through screenings such as mammograms is key to successful treatment, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies.<br><br></p>
            <p id="c">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Endometrial and cervical cancer.</b> Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium. It is the most common gynecologic cancer and often presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, particularly after menopause. Early detection through medical evaluation of these symptoms can lead to a better prognosis, with treatment options including surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.<br>
                
                <br>Cervical cancer originates in the cells lining the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus connecting to the vagina. It is often caused by persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancer can be detected early through regular Pap smears and HPV testing. Treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies depending on the stage and type of the cancer.<br><br></p>
            
            <p id="d">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Melanoma skin cancer.</b> Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing pigment in the skin. It is considered the most serious form of skin cancer because it can spread quickly to other parts of the body if not detected early. Melanoma often appears as an unusual mole or dark spot on the skin that changes in size, shape, or color. Early diagnosis through regular skin checks and prompt treatment, such as surgical removal of the melanoma, can improve outcomes.<br><br></p>

            <h3 class="info-head" id="autoimm">Autoimmune diseases</h3>

            <p id="e">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lupus.</b> Lupus, also known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues in various parts of the body. This can lead to inflammation, pain, and damage in organs such as the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. Symptoms can vary widely and may include fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and fever. While there is no cure for lupus, treatment options such as medications and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and reduce flares.<br><br></p>
            <p id="f">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Multiple Sclerosis.</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin, leading to communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Symptoms can vary widely and may include fatigue, vision problems, numbness or tingling, and difficulty with coordination and movement. While there is no cure for MS, treatments such as medications and physical therapy can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression.<br><br></p>
            <p id="g">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rheumatoid arthritis.</b> Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and stiffness. In RA, the immune system mistakenly attacks the synovium, the lining of the joints, leading to joint damage and potential deformity over time. Symptoms can also include fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. While there is no cure for RA, treatments such as medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<br><br></p>
            <p id="h">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sjögren’s syndrome.</b> Sjögren’s syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the moisture-producing glands, such as the salivary and tear glands, resulting in dry mouth and dry eyes. The condition can also affect other parts of the body, including the skin, joints, and organs, causing symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, and dry skin. Sjögren’s syndrome can occur on its own or in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. While there is no cure, treatments such as artificial tears, saliva substitutes, and medications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<br><br></p>
            <p id="i">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inflammatory bowel diseases.</b> Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic conditions that cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus, and may involve patches of inflamed tissue. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, primarily affects the colon and rectum, causing continuous inflammation and sores. Symptoms of IBD can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. Although there is no cure, treatments such as medication, dietary changes, and surgery can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<br><br></p>
            <p id="j">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Celiac disease.</b> Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When someone with celiac disease consumes gluten, their immune system attacks the lining of the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage that interferes with nutrient absorption. Symptoms can vary widely and may include digestive issues such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, as well as other symptoms like fatigue and skin rashes. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet, which helps alleviate symptoms and promote intestinal healing.<br><br></p>

            <h3 class="info-head" id="asthall">Asthma and Allergies</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Asthma and Allergies.</b> Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Asthma can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, cold air, and respiratory infections. While there is no cure, medications and management strategies can help control symptoms and improve quality of life.<br>

                <br>Allergies are immune system reactions to typically harmless substances such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or certain foods. When a person with allergies is exposed to a trigger, their immune system releases chemicals like histamine, causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, or skin rashes. Treatment options for allergies include avoidance of triggers, antihistamines, and other medications to manage symptoms.<br><br></p>

            <h3 class="info-head" id="cardio">Cardiovascular diseases</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cardiovascular diseases.</b> Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) refer to a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and arrhythmias. These diseases are often caused by a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow and damage to the heart and other organs. Symptoms can vary depending on the specific condition but may include chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, or numbness in the limbs. Risk factors for CVDs include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, medications, and, in some cases, medical procedures or surgeries to manage symptoms and prevent complications.<br><br></p>

            <h3 class="info-head" id="pelvicother">Other pelvic conditions</h3>

            <p id="k">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Adenomyosis.</b> Adenomyosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus (the endometrium) grows into the muscular wall of the uterus. This can cause the uterus to become enlarged and lead to heavy menstrual bleeding, severe menstrual pain, and pressure or discomfort in the pelvic region. The exact cause of adenomyosis is unknown, but it is most commonly found in women who have had children or undergone uterine surgery. Treatment options include pain management with medications, hormone therapy, or, in severe cases, surgery such as a hysterectomy to remove the uterus.<br><br></p>
            <p id="l">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Polycystic ovarian syndrome.</b> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts on the ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles, and elevated levels of male hormones (androgens). These hormonal imbalances can lead to symptoms such as acne, excess hair growth, weight gain, and difficulty getting pregnant. PCOS can also increase the risk of developing other health issues, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. While there is no cure for PCOS, treatments such as medications, lifestyle changes, and fertility treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.<br><br></p>
            <p id="m">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Pelvic Congestion Syndrome.</b> Pelvic congestion syndrome is a chronic condition that occurs when the veins in the pelvic area become enlarged and twisted, leading to pain and discomfort. The condition is caused by poor blood flow in the pelvic veins, which may result from valve dysfunction or other vascular issues. Symptoms often include dull, aching pain in the lower abdomen or back, which may worsen after prolonged standing or during menstruation. Diagnosis can be challenging, and treatments may include medications to relieve pain, minimally invasive procedures to close or block the affected veins, or surgical options in more severe cases.<br><br></p>
