        <h2 class="main-art-head">Treatment Options for Endometriosis</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, causing pain and other complications. While there is no known cure for endometriosis, there are several treatment options available to help manage the pain and symptoms. These include hormone therapy, pain medications, and surgical procedures to remove the abnormal tissue growth.</p>

        <h3 class="info-head" id="pain-med">Pain Medications</h3>

            <p id="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>NSAIDs.</b> A group of painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used to treat period pain, as well as endometriosis. These painkillers include ibuprofen, diclofenac and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA – the drug in medicines like Aspirin). Some of these drugs can be bought “over the counter” in pharmacies, others are only available on prescription, particularly if taken in higher doses. <br><br> NSAIDs can provide effective period pain relief and are usually well tolerated. But there is hardly any research on whether they also help relieve pain caused by endometriosis. These medications can cause side effects such as stomach problems, nausea and headaches. ASA also prevents blood from coagulating (clotting). For these reasons, people shouldn't take painkillers frequently or over long periods of time without consulting their doctor.<br><br></p>
            <p id="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Opiods.</b> If women have more severe pain, drugs known as opioids are sometimes used too. Opioids act in a similar way to pain-relieving substances made in the body, influencing pain perception in the brain. These drugs are only allowed to be used if prescribed by a doctor. There is a risk of becoming dependent on them, particularly stronger kinds, if they are taken for long periods of time. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, tiredness, dizziness and changes in blood pressure. There is currently no reliable research on the effectiveness of these painkillers in the treatment of endometriosis.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="info-head" id="hormone-ther">Hormone Therapy</h3>

            <p id="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Oral contraceptives.</b> Most contraceptive pills have been proven to relieve endometriosis-related pain. But if a woman has bad period pain (dysmenorrhea), the period-like bleeding at the end of a pill cycle – known as withdrawal bleeding – can still be painful. The main side effects of the pill include headaches, fluid retention and breast tenderness.<br><br>Some types of contraceptive pill can be used to suppress a woman’s monthly hormone cycle and period for a longer amount of time too. To do so, they are taken continuously, without any breaks – or with less frequent breaks – between cycles. The continuous use of the pill is sometimes referred to as an “extended-cycle regimen.”<br><br></p>
            <p id="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone drugs.</b> Hormone drugs known as GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogues or GnRH agonists can relieve endometriosis symptoms too. But they have stronger side effects than the pill: They reduce the production of female sex hormones so much that they often cause problems related to estrogen deficiency. These are similar to the problems women may have during menopause, such as hot flashes, sleep problems, vaginal dryness and mood swings.<br><br>When used over longer periods of time, GnRH analogues may also reduce women’s bone density. Research suggests that their bone density returns to normal within two years of stopping this treatment. If a woman uses GnRH analogues for longer than six months, she can also start hormone therapy with low doses of estrogen at the same time. This approach is called “add-back therapy” and aims to reduce problems associated with estrogen deficiency.<br><br></p>
            <p id="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Progestin-releasing hormone implants.</b> Drugs containing the hormone progestin also relieve pain in endometriosis. Progestins can have side effects like spotting (light period-like bleeding between cycles), weight gain, feeling down and reduced sexual desire.<br><br>There is a progestin-containing coil (the LNG-IUS, short for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) which can be inserted into the womb. In the treatment of endometriosis, the LNG-IUS has only been studied as an additional treatment to surgery. When combined with surgery, it can relieve endometriosis symptoms better than surgery alone. The LNG-IUS is also used as a contraceptive. This has been shown to cause side effects such as spotting, abdominal pain, headaches and breast tenderness.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="info-head" id="surgery">Surgical Options</h3>

            <p id="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Exploratory surgery.</b> Laparoscopy is the most common procedure used to diagnose and remove mild to moderate endometriosis. Instead of using a large incision in the belly, the surgeon inserts a lighted viewing tool called a laparoscope through a small incision. If better access is needed, the surgeon makes one or two more small incisions for inserting other surgical tools.<br><br></p>
            <p id="7">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Endometriosis excision.</b> Excision of endometriotic lesions or nodules involves cutting out visible areas of endometriosis (excision), or burning them off. Other medical terms that describe the destruction of endometriosis are “ablation and fulguration” which are used with different kinds of energy sources. Excision of superficial peritoneal endometriosis lesions has a benefit of providing pathological confirmation because the excised tissue is sent to the laboratory for evaluation. However, both excision and destruction/ablation techniques are equally effective with improving pain symptoms. Similarly, research studies have shown that both excision and destruction of endometriosis at the time of laparoscopy improves future fertility compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone.<br><br></p>
            <p id="8">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Removal of uterus and/or ovaries.</b> If women have endometrial implants in their womb, and these are causing severe symptoms, they may consider having surgery to remove their womb (a hysterectomy). Endometrial implants near to the womb can be removed at the same time.<br>

                <br>Most women only consider having a hysterectomy if their endometriosis is a real problem in everyday life, other treatments have failed, and they are sure that they don't want to have any (more) children. The woman’s age plays an important role when deciding whether or not to have a hysterectomy. And having this kind of surgery only makes sense if it is likely to lead to an improvement in symptoms.<br>
                
                <br>Removing the womb alone doesn't guarantee that the endometriosis will be gone afterwards. If the fallopian tubes and ovaries aren't removed too, women might still have endometriosis symptoms. So they are faced with another difficult decision: Removing both ovaries causes the production of female sex hormones to stop, leading to sudden early menopause. Menopause normally starts between the ages of 40 and 50. The average age at which women have their last period is 51.<br>
                
                <br>Women who have their womb removed usually don't also have their ovaries removed, to keep up the production of hormones.<br>
                
                <br>If the ovaries are removed too, then any remaining endometrial implants in the body stop getting the hormones they need to grow. But the general problems caused by the drop in hormones after this operation can be so severe that some women decide to take estrogen. This hormone therapy might make the endometriosis symptoms return.<br>
                
                <br>As with all surgical procedures done using an anesthetic, surgery for endometriosis can also lead to complications like organ damage, bleeding or infections. These occur in about 5 out of 100 women.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="info-head" id="alt-med">Alternative Medicine</h3>

            <p id="9">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Herbal rememdies, acupunture, homeopathy.</b> Several studies have found that acupuncture can help endometriosis symptoms. It may also improve pregnancy rates among people with endometriosis who are trying to conceive.<br>

                <br>However, acupuncture has not become a part of the standard of care. This is becauseTrusted Source typical treatments, such as hormone therapies and surgery, have more robust evidence supporting their use. It is also important to note that the lack of accessibility to acupuncture and the fact insurers do not offer coverage for it means that it may be less common in practice.<br>
                
                <br>Acupuncture might complement these treatments, but there is insufficient evidence that it could replace them. Most studies of the method for treating endometriosis have been small in size and lack quality placebo controls.<br><br></p>
            <p id="10">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>TENS therapy.</b> TENS works by causing your body to release natural painkillers called endorphins.  Research has shown that people with endometriosis using a TENS machine at home for pain relief don't need to use as much medication.  TENS can also help increase the length of time your pain is reduced. This can be very empowering, allowing you to be more in control of how you manage your symptoms. It can also improve your quality of life and allow you to do the things you enjoy without pain.<br><br></p>
            <p id="11">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Yoga.</b> Research suggests that yoga does help to manage endometriosis symptoms. A group of Brazilian researchers randomly divided 40 people with the condition into two groups: those with a gentle Hatha yoga practice and those going about their regular lives without an additional practice. For two months, the group that practiced yoga attended two ninety-minute classes per week.<br>

                <br>At the end of the study, the two groups were compared. The people who practiced yoga reported significantly less daily pain, as well as an improved sense of well-being, according to results published in January 2017 in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.<br>
                
                <br>For many people with endometriosis, their nervous system and immune system are under attack all the time. The body heals best when it’s not in a stressed fight-flight-freeze state. This is why yoga can be so beneficial for when you’re suffering from endometriosis.<br><br></p>
            <p id="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lifestyle changes.</b> Nutritional interventions may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of endometriosis and associated pain. Reducing dietary fat and increasing dietary fiber have been shown to reduce circulating estrogen concentrations, suggesting a potential benefit for individuals with endometriosis, as it is an estrogen-dependent disease. Meat consumption is associated with greater risk of developing endometriosis. Anti-inflammatory properties of plant-based diets may benefit women with endometriosis. Additionally, seaweed holds estrogen-modulating properties that have benefitted postmenopausal women and offers potential to reduce estradiol concentrations in pre-menopausal women. Furthermore, consumption of vitamin D has been shown to reduce endometrial pain via increased antioxidant capacity and supplementation with vitamins C and E significantly reduced endometriosis symptoms, compared with placebo.<br><br></p>
