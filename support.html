                    <h4>ðŸŒ» - Endometriosis Association Official Site</h4>

                        <p>The Endometriosis Association is the recognized authority on endometriosis, a life-altering hormone and immune system disease affecting millions worldwide. Nothing on this page should be taken as medical advice.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is our vision that, worldwide:<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* every girl, woman, and family affected by endometriosis and its related diseases will have support, knowledge, and help in securing accurate, early diagnosis and effective treatment for this chronic, painful, and complex disease;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* every girl, woman, and family affected by endometriosis and its related diseases will be empowered to advocate for their own physical and emotional health, and to help others affected by endometriosis to do so;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* and that in turn those affected by endometriosis will help change the environmental and other contributing factors linked to endometriosis to diminish the occurrence and severity of endometriosis and related diseases;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* our members, the medical community, and the public will understand that pain with female reproductive function is not normal and that endometriosis is a systemic disease with associated immune, endocrine, and other aspects;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* our research will contribute to finding causes, treatments, prevention, and a cure for endometriosis and related health problems.
                        <br>

                <h3 class="info-head" id="healthWom">HealthyWomen</h3>

                    <p>HealthyWomen is dedicated to educating women in the middle â€” ages 35 to 64 â€” so they can make informed health decisions, advocate for themselves and prioritize their health and wellness.<br>

We keep women's health part of the national dialogue by raising awareness to decision makers about the impact health policy has on women and families. And we work collaboratively with partner organizations and alliances to reach more women.<br>

                    <br>Some of our work is created with support by the generous support of our funders. We implement timely, evidence-based educational programs, national events and campaign initiatives on specific topics important to women and their health. The support allows us to create educational content grounded in science, free of commercial bias, and widely accessible to all.<br></p>

                <h3 class="info-head" id="march">Endometriosis Worldwide March</h3>

                    <p><br>The EndoMarch Global Movement leads the fight for urgently-needed improvement to the way we diagnosis and treat of endometriosis, a potentially crippling, whole-body chronic disease, affecting an estimated 200 million women, girls, and transgender individuals around the world. The movement has ignited an international response from women and men in 60+ countries and counting, leading to dramatically increased awareness and policy changes around the world, including a bipartisan bill to increase federal funding for endometriosis research and public awareness campaigns.<br>

                        <br>Since our first campaign in 2014, the Worldwide EndoMarch has grown to be the largest, internationally-coordinated endometriosis coalition in the world, representing over 100 organizations, groups, and medical societies. These groups join together for Annual Worldwide Marches, to share the facts and their stories, and to fight for change and address the urgent unmet needs of those suffering with endometriosis.<br></p>

                <h3 class="info-head" id="endoFound">The Endometriosis Foundation</h3>

                    <p>Having started out as a small online community support group, we have flourished into an ever-growing community now helping more than 10,000 members.<br>

                    <br>Community support groups are a great way to connect with others going through similar experiences, helping you feel less alone. It's a place where you can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable telling about yourself and your concerns, and you can post anonymously too.<br>
                
                    <br>The advice shared within our community is given solely based on individuals and their personal experiences. Accordingly, we always suggest that you speak to your GP or medical team if you require medical advice or before you follow any advice given by members of our community support groups.<br>

                    <br>Many members of our community are still learning. Some may have concerns at first and you may see a lot of worried posts. But over time with the right support, posts become more positive. Thousands of our members have really positive experiences- but itâ€™s just that people donâ€™t post as much when things are going well.<br>

                    <br>We look forward to welcoming you to our community.</p>
